Authentication
       Authentication is a strategy used in computer science
 to limit access to an application to a group of verified 
individuals. 
Users are verified based on the credentials provided 
before granting the user access to the program.
For creating Authentication
        1.constructor(form, fields) { this. form = form; this. ...
2.// create a variable for the login form const form = document. ...
3.const auth = new Auth(); document.
